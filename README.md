Company A needs to find out what their Total Monthly Cost is for all vehicles they operate. 
Used Pivot Tables to find out the sum of OverTime Cost and total number of days each vehicle was in use.
Calculated the base rate, total monthly rate, total + overtime and final total using formulas and functions.
Created an interactive dashboard with column, bar, combo charts to visualize the data and provide insights to the business.
